<h1>The Sophisticated Beast</h1>
<p>We are a small brewery who thinks big. We don’t dabble in the mundane,
favouring wild ferment, farmhouse style beers that challenge your mind
as much as your palate. We push back against the assumption that the fun
beers have to be seasonal - we do fun all year round. Although our beers are
unconventional, that doesn’t mean they are unsophisticated - above all our
beers are flavoursome, well-made and unforgettable.</p>
